GeoAlchemy Change Log
=====================

0.3.1
-----

* Fix for py2.5 syntax errors

0.3
-----

* GeoAlchemy supports Oracle
* Introduced RAW attribute, so that the geometry column can
    be used in a select clause without being surrounded with
    'AsBinary(..)'
    >>> session.query(func.extent(Spot.spot_location.RAW)).first()

0.2
---

* Ported to SQLAlchemy 0.6
* When fetching objects of mapped classes, the geometry column
	is queried in WKB.
* The WKB value of a geometry column can be accessed directly,
	without making a new database query, using the attribute 
	geom_wkb (for example: s.the_geom.geom_wkb).
* Introduced DBSpatialElement that can be used to wrap the
	result of a database function, that returned a new geometry, so
	that new queries can be executed on the result.
	>>> buffer_geom = DBSpatialElement(session.scalar(r.geom.buffer(10.0)))
	>>> session.scalar(buffer_geom.wkt)
* Removed 'SFS' flag for GeometryColumn.
* When using database specific functions on geometry columns 
	(Spot.geom.kml, but not s.geom.kml!), a comparator has to be set
	manually when defining the mapping.
* Updated documentation and examples.
* Use spatial index for Spatialite.
* Set NOT NULL constraints in database (nullable=False).
* GeometryBase: changed default value of dimension to 2.
