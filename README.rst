GIS Support for `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org/>`_.

Introduction
------------
GeoAlchemy is an extension of SQLAlchemy. It provides support for
Geospatial data types at the ORM layer using SQLAlchemy. It aims to
support spatial operations and relations specified by the Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC). The project started under Google Summer of Code Program
under the mentorship of `Mark Ramm-Christensen <http://compoundthinking.com/blog/>`_.

Requirements
------------
Requires SQLAlchemy > 0.6. Supported on Python 2.5 and Python 2.6.
Should also work with Python 2.4 but has not been tested. It also
requires a supported spatial database.

<http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite/>`_, `MySQL <http://www.mysql.com/>`_,
